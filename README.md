# Kepleomax

# About the app
Kepleomax is my personal pet project. The list of features:
- email/password login (using JWT)
- profile editor
- realtime chat with notifications (using socket io and fcm)
- post editor
- feed page with posts (no likes for now)
- people search
- chat with ChatGPT (without some special promt)

The backend was also made by me using node.js, express and deployed on google vm. 
You can check it here: https://github.com/Yudnikov-Leonid/KepLeoMax_Backend

Don't ask me about the name and icon. It's a reference to a stupid meme, you don't need to know it :)
